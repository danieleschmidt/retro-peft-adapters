"""
MLOps Module for Retro-PEFT-Adapters

Comprehensive MLOps implementation for production-grade deployment,
monitoring, and lifecycle management of retrieval-augmented adapters
with automated pipelines and intelligent orchestration.

Key Components:
- ExperimentTracker: Advanced experiment tracking and model versioning
- ModelRegistry: Centralized model registry with lineage tracking
- PipelineOrchestrator: Automated ML pipelines with intelligent scheduling
- MonitoringSystem: Real-time model and data monitoring
- AutoMLOptimizer: Automated hyperparameter and architecture optimization
- DeploymentManager: Multi-environment deployment orchestration
