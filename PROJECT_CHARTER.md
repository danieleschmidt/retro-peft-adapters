# Project Charter: Retro-PEFT-Adapters

## Executive Summary

Retro-PEFT-Adapters is an open-source library that combines Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enable efficient domain adaptation of large language models. The project aims to reduce the computational cost and complexity of model customization while maintaining or improving performance through intelligent knowledge retrieval.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

1. **High Cost of Model Adaptation**: Full fine-tuning of large language models requires substantial computational resources and time
2. **Domain Knowledge Limitations**: Models lack access to up-to-date or specialized domain knowledge without retraining
3. **Parameter Efficiency**: Traditional fine-tuning methods update millions or billions of parameters for domain-specific tasks
4. **Knowledge Staleness**: Static models become outdated as domain knowledge evolves
5. **Deployment Complexity**: Managing multiple fine-tuned models for different domains is operationally challenging

### Market Need

Organizations across industries need to adapt large language models to their specific domains and use cases while maintaining operational efficiency. Current solutions force a trade-off between adaptation quality and resource requirements.
